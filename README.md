# Vineyard Cam

Camera targeted at Vineyards.  

I order to gather data for a machine learning project, I needed more pictures of grapes in their various stages of growth. I found my team mate was spending a lot of time labeling the pictures after she took the pictures.  This special camera app gives her the ability to label the images as she is taking the pictures, as well as help keep track of how many pictures she has taken of each vine.

The gathering of data is the most laborius part of any machine learning project. This app is intended to help alleviate that load.

The app features a gallery to delete pictures.

With the camera operational:<br>

This is my first Android app, I had to buy a Google Pixel just to create and test it.  

The requirements are pretty stiff, with Android 9 being required.
